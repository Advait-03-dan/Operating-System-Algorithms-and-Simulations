# Operating-System-Algorithms-and-Simulations

Process Scheduling Simulator: Developed a simulator to execute Round Robin, First Come First Served (FCFS), and preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF), providing insights into process execution times.

Banker's Algorithm: Implemented Banker's Algorithm to simulate resource allocation and ensure system safety by avoiding deadlock through dynamic resource availability checks.

LRU Cache Paging Replacement: Created an LRU Cache algorithm using a doubly linked list and hash map simulating page replacement and calculating total page faults based on reference strings
